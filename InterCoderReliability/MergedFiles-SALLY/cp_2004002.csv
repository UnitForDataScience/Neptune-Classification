U,The licensee used pictures taken during the previous inspection in Refueling Outage 2RF06 to make comparisons and help determine whether or not any changes had occurred since the last inspection.,232,306,501,cp_2004002.txt
U,"This was done on the spot, at the time of the inspection, via a notebook that contained pictures of each VHP nozzle and each of the four quadrant views for that VHP nozzle.",232,501,673,cp_2004002.txt
U,Any discrepancies were documented on the recorded video and new pictures were captured to replace unclear or changed conditions.,232,673,801,cp_2004002.txt
U,"The inspectors verified that the Reactor Vessel Head Visual Examination Plan provided: (1) description of the bare metal visual inspection technique, the administration of this inspection, and the expectation of 100 percent inspection coverage; (2) explicit descriptions of the types of boric acid indications that might be identified; (3) types of indications that shall be investigated further, including boric acid buildup, wastage of carbon steel, and evidence of primary water leakage; (4) criteria for cleaning the upper head and general area; and (5) acceptance criteria for the inspection.",232,801,1398,cp_2004002.txt

U,".2 Condition of reactor vessel upper head The examination determined that the reactor vessel head outer surface was uniformly coated with a very thin layer of loose, grey dust.",232,1824,2000,cp_2004002.txt
U,This was consistent with the previous inspection and no change in reactor vessel head outer surface was identified.,232,2000,2115,cp_2004002.txt
U,A sample of the material had previously been evaluated and was determined to be consistent with concrete dust.,232,2115,2225,cp_2004002.txt
U,It was concluded that the reactor vessel head surface was sound.,232,2225,2289,cp_2004002.txt
U,"As identified during the last examination, some penetration tube bases had some small amounts of debris in or near the annulus region.",232,2289,2423,cp_2004002.txt

U,".6 Basis for temperatures used in susceptibility rankings CPSES uses the reactor coolant system cold leg temperature of 561EF (nominal) in the equation contained in Electric Power Research Institute EPRI Document MRP-48, ""PWR Materials Reliability Program Response to NRC Bulletin 2001-01,"" August 2001 (also contained in TI2515/150, Revision 1).",236,1088,1434,cp_2004002.txt
U,The nominal cold leg temperature was used as the reactor vessel head temperature because of the RPV design at CPSES.,236,1434,1550,cp_2004002.txt
U,The RPV is designed such that part of the flow from the cold legs is diverted to the reactor vessel head area.,236,1550,1660,cp_2004002.txt

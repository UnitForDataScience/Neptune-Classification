# Classification Results

## Project Structure

### 1. GloVe
contains the results generated by classification model - GloVe + CNN + LSTM. The results include 
predictions and accuracies of Test Data of all 'Dataset Types'.

### 2. GoogleW2V
contains the results generated by classification model - PreTrained Google Word2Vec + CNN + LSTM. The results include 
predictions and accuracies of Test Data of all 'Dataset Types'.

### 3. TrainedW2V
contains the results generated by classification model - SelfTrained Word2Vec + CNN + LSTM. The results include 
predictions and accuracies of Test Data of all 'Dataset Types'.

### 4. BERT
contains the results generated by classification model - BERT. The results include 
predictions and accuracies of Test Data of all 'Dataset Types'.

### 5. ULMFit
contains the results generated by classification model - ULMFit. The results include 
predictions and accuracies of Test Data of all 'Dataset Types'.

### Result_Viz.ipynb
This is to compile, visualize, observe and compare the results generated by all the Classification Models on all the 'Dataset Types'. 
The results include:
- No. of Training datapoints
- No. of Test datapoints
- Training Accuracy
- Validation Accuracy
- Test Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix of Predictions of Test Data

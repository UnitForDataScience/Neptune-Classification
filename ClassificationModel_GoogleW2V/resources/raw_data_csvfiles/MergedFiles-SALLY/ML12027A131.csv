U,Findings Introduction: The inspectors identified a finding of very low safety significance (Green) involving a NCV of Vogtle Unit 1 Operating License Condition 2.G and Unit 2 Operating License Condition 2.G to implement and maintain all aspects of the approved fire protection program (FPP).,174,6,297,ML12027A131.txt
O,"Specifically, the licensee failed to ensure that, during postfire safe shutdown involving a large fire in the main control room (MCR), Unit 1 and Unit 2 RCS process variables would be maintained within those predicted for a loss of normal ac power.",174,297,545,ML12027A131.txt
U,"This finding is applicable to fires in Fire Area (FA) 1-CB-L1-A/ Fire Zones (FZ) 105-1, Unit 1 MCR and FZ 105-2, Unit 2 MCR.",174,545,669,ML12027A131.txt
U,A fire in this area would involve evacuation of the MCR and shutdown of both units using the remote shutdown panels (RSPs).,174,669,792,ML12027A131.txt
U,"Description: This issue was identified by the inspectors in NRC inspection report (IR) 05000424, 425/2010006.",174,792,901,ML12027A131.txt
U,"As described in this IR, inspectors reviewed the Control Room Fire Alternate Shutdown Evaluation (CRFASE), calculation number X4C2301S035, and procedure 18038-1, Operation from Remote Shutdown Panels (RSPs).",174,901,1108,ML12027A131.txt
U,The CRFASE evaluates discrete spurious operation concerns and provides time constraints and operator actions to mitigate these events.,174,1108,1242,ML12027A131.txt
U,"The inspectors subsequently questioned whether certain steps in procedure 18038-1, in the event of a large fire in FA 1-CB-L1-A that would require evacuation of the Unit 1 and Unit 2 MCRs, would be able to be performed from the RSPs within the time constraints specified in the CRFASE in order to prevent or mitigate the adverse effects of certain spurious actuations.",174,1242,1610,ML12027A131.txt
U,"One of the steps in question, step 30, was intended to prevent depressurization of the RCS to the safety injection (SI) actuation set point, in the event one pressurizer spray valve spuriously opened.",174,1610,1810,ML12027A131.txt
U,After the on-site inspection the licensee developed a simulator exercise guide for the purpose of validating the time necessary for an operating crew to perform the steps of procedure 18038-1 in question.,174,1810,2014,ML12027A131.txt
U,"When validating the simulator exercise guide, the licensee found that the CRFASE does not reflect integrated plant response for a control room fire, requiring shutdown from the RSPs, as predicted through simulation.",174,2014,2229,ML12027A131.txt
U,Simulated plant response was different from the response described in the CRFASE in that an automatic SI actuation occurred approximately 6 minutes after plant trip due to decreasing RCS pressure arising from an uncontrolled RCS cooldown caused by high auxiliary feedwater (AFW) flow.,174,2229,2513,ML12027A131.txt
U,"As discussed in the CRFASE, steam generator level control is necessary to preclude uncontrolled RCS cooldown and depressurization.",174,2513,2643,ML12027A131.txt
U,"Inspectors noted that an automatic SI actuation would occur in approximately 6 minutes; however, it would take operators approximately 15 minutes to transfer control of the plant from the MCR to the RSP, as documented in the CRFASE.",174,2643,2875,ML12027A131.txt
U,"Additionally, inspectors determined that a decrease in RCS pressure to the SI setpoint, approximately 6 minutes after the reactor was tripped, would not be expected to occur during a normal loss of ac power.",174,2875,3082,ML12027A131.txt

U,"Specifically, in FSAR Appendix 9B, Section C.5.c, the licensee states, in part, that with alternative or dedicated shutdown capability, the RCS process variables can be maintained within those limits predicted for a loss of normal ac power.",176,719,959,ML12027A131.txt

U,"The major analysis assumptions included: (1) Only main control room (MCR) fires would require the use of procedure 18038-1, (2) Only large MCR fires would require MCR room abandonment without ability to secure AFW pumps and throttle flow prior to abandonment (3) Failure to promptly throttle AFW flow during alternate safe shutdown could result in safety injection actuation and steam generator overfill.",176,2028,2432,ML12027A131.txt
U,"The dominant sequence would be a large MCR fire causing a reactor trip and a rapid abandonment, failure to throttle AFW flow resulting in safety injection initiation and steam generator overfill and loss of the TDAFW pump, and failure of motor driven AFW and failure of feed and bleed leading to loss of core heat removal and core damage.",176,2432,2770,ML12027A131.txt

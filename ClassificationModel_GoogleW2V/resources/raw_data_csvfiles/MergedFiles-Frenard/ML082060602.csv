SUMMARY OF FINDINGS IR 05000440/2008003; 04/01/2008 Â­ 06/30/2008; Identification and Resolution of Problems The inspection was conducted by resident and regional inspectors.,59,0,174,ML082060602.txt,U
The report covers a three-month period of resident inspection.,59,174,236,ML082060602.txt,U
"The significance of most findings is indicated by their color (Green, White, Yellow, Red) using Inspection Manual Chapter (IMC) 0609 ""Significance Determination Process"" (SDP).",59,236,412,ML082060602.txt,U
"Findings for which the SDP does not apply may be ""Green,"" or be assigned a severity level after NRC management review.",59,412,530,ML082060602.txt,U
"The NRC's program for overseeing the safe operation of commercial nuclear power reactors is described in NUREG-1649, ""Reactor Oversight Process,"" Revision 4, dated July 2006.",59,530,704,ML082060602.txt,U
A. Inspector-Identified and Self-Revealed Findings Cornerstone: Initiating Event Â· Green The inspectors identified a finding of very low safety significance for the failure of licensee personnel to adhere to corrective action program procedures.,59,704,949,ML082060602.txt,U
"Specifically, during inspection of the linear velocity transducer connector for the 'A' flow control valve actuator, the connector was found in a degraded state, and personnel applied tape to the connector.",59,949,1155,ML082060602.txt,T
"Licensee personnel did not initiate a condition report to address this condition or to assess operability, and the connector later failed causing reactor flow and power oscillations.",59,1155,1337,ML082060602.txt,"O, T, P"
The licensee entered the issue of failure to adhere to corrective action program procedures into their corrective action program.,59,1337,1466,ML082060602.txt,U
This finding has a cross-cutting aspect in the area of Problem Identification and Resolution because the organization failed to properly identify issues related to nuclear safety P.1(a).,59,1466,1652,ML082060602.txt,O
This finding was considered more than minor because it was associated with the equipment performance attribute of the Initiating Events cornerstone and adversely affected the cornerstone objective of limiting the likelihood of events that upset plant stability.,59,1652,1913,ML082060602.txt,"O, P"
The finding was determined through a Significance Determination Process analysis to be of very low safety significance because no mitigation equipment or functions were affected.,59,1913,2091,ML082060602.txt,U
No violation of NRC requirements occurred.,59,2091,2133,ML082060602.txt,U
(Section 4OA2) B. Licensee-Identified Violations Three violations of very low safety significance that were identified by the licensee have been reviewed by the inspectors.,59,2133,2305,ML082060602.txt,U
"Additionally, one violation of very low safety significance, which was identified by the licensee and was the subject of an investigation by the NRC Office of Investigations (OI) was also reviewed.",59,2305,2502,ML082060602.txt,U
Corrective actions planned or taken by the licensee have been entered into the licensee's corrective action program.,59,2502,2618,ML082060602.txt,U
These violations and corrective action tracking numbers are listed in Section 4OA7 of this report.,59,2618,2716,ML082060602.txt,U

"Inspection Scope During the week of May 19, 2008, the inspectors verified that plant features and procedures for operation and continued availability of offsite and alternate AC power systems during adverse weather were appropriate.",65,1237,1469,ML082060602.txt,U
The inspectors reviewed the licensee's procedures affecting these areas and the communications protocols between the transmission system operator (TSO) and the plant to verify that the appropriate information was being exchanged when issues arose that could impact the offsite power system.,65,1469,1759,ML082060602.txt,U
Examples of aspects considered in the inspectors' review included: Â· Â· Â· Â· coordination between the TSO and the plant during off-normal or emergency events; explanations for the events; estimates of when the offsite power system would be returned to a normal state; and notifications from the TSO to the plant when the offsite power system was returned to normal.,65,1759,2122,ML082060602.txt,U
The inspectors also verified that plant procedures addressed measures to monitor and maintain availability and reliability of both the offsite AC power system and the onsite alternate AC power system prior to or during adverse weather conditions.,67,0,246,ML082060602.txt,U

"During the inspection, the inspectors focused on plant-specific design features and the licensee's procedures used to mitigate or respond to adverse weather conditions.",79,806,974,ML082060602.txt,U
"Additionally, the inspectors reviewed the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) and performance requirements for systems selected for inspection, and verified that operator actions were appropriate as specified by plant-specific procedures.",79,974,1221,ML082060602.txt,U

"Inspection Scope The inspectors performed partial system walkdowns of the following risk-significant systems: Â· Â· Â· emergency closed cooling water (ECCW) 'B' during a Division 1 work week on May 15, 2008; containment system during the week of May 15, 2008; and emergency service water (ESW) system following repair of the high pressure core spray (HPCS) ESW keep-fill system during the week of June 23, 2008.",87,132,540,ML082060602.txt,U
The inspectors selected these systems based on their risk significance relative to the reactor safety cornerstones at the time they were inspected.,89,0,147,ML082060602.txt,U
"The inspectors attempted to identify any discrepancies that could impact the function of the system, and, therefore, potentially increase risk.",89,147,290,ML082060602.txt,U
"The inspectors reviewed applicable operating procedures, system diagrams, UFSAR, Technical Specification (TS) requirements, outstanding work orders (WOs), condition reports (CRs), and the impact of ongoing work activities on redundant trains of equipment in order to identify conditions that could have rendered the systems incapable of performing their intended functions.",89,290,663,ML082060602.txt,U
The inspectors also walked down accessible portions of the systems to verify system components and support equipment were aligned correctly and operable.,89,663,816,ML082060602.txt,U
The inspectors examined the material condition of the components and observed operating parameters of equipment to verify that there were no obvious deficiencies.,89,816,978,ML082060602.txt,U
The inspectors also verified that the licensee had properly identified and resolved equipment alignment problems that could cause initiating events or impact the capability of mitigating systems or barriers and entered them into the CAP with the appropriate significance characterization.,89,978,1266,ML082060602.txt,U

Findings Failure to Identify a Condition Adverse to Quality Related to the Reactor Recirculation System Introduction: A finding of very low safety significance (GREEN) was identified by the inspectors for the licensee's failure to adhere to CAP procedures following the identification of a degraded condition affecting the 'A' recirculation system flow control valve (FCV).,185,1580,1953,ML082060602.txt,"O, P"
"Description: On May 14, 2008, during review of previous plant events related to the reactor recirculation system, the inspectors determined that a degraded condition of the linear velocity transducer (LVT) connector for FCV 'A' was found by licensee personnel during a refueling outage in May 2007.",185,1953,2251,ML082060602.txt,"O, P"
"Following the refueling outage, beginning on May 24, 2007, the 'A' FCV experienced unexpected oscillations, which continued to worsen until June 5, 2007, when the 'A' FCV was manually locked by operators to prevent the condition from potentially causing reactor power transients greater than 11 percent per second.",185,2251,2565,ML082060602.txt,U

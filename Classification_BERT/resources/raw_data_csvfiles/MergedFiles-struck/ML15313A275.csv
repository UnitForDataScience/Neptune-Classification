"The licensee quickly determined that due to the coincident level changes, the Unit 1 RHR recirculation sump suction valves were likely not fully isolated Â­ allowing back-leakage from the 11 RWST through the valve seats of the recirculation sump suction valves and into the Unit 1 recirculation sump `B'.",109,709,1012,ML15313A275.txt,U
Further licensee troubleshooting was conducted in the weeks following discovery of the back-leakage and the determination was made that the Unit 1 `B' RHR recirculation sump valves were not fully isolating the suction piping of the Unit 1 `B' RHR system such that the 11 RWST was slowly back-leaking into the Unit 1 recirculation sump `B'.,109,1012,1351,ML15313A275.txt,U

"Additionally, during the review of POD 01491302, the inspectors noted that although the licensee had evaluated the RHR recirculation sump valve's safety function to close aspect of the original issue, there was no evaluation of the known, ongoing back-leakage discovered in June of 2015 and the resultant impact on operability.",111,385,712,ML15313A275.txt,P

"Specifically, no compensatory measure(s) were determined (and no bases were documented for no compensatory measure(s)) to ensure the non-conforming condition would be re-evaluated should the valves be stroked following a forced or maintenance outage Â­ which could result in a change in the leakage rate.",111,1821,2124,ML15313A275.txt,T
The station generated CAP 01492948 and revised POD 01491900 which determined an appropriate compensatory measure to perform additional monitoring/evaluation of the condition to ensure the original POD conclusions remained valid if any valves were stroked.,111,2124,2379,ML15313A275.txt,P
"Following resolution of the inspector's concerns for these PODs, the station also generated CAPs 01490027, 01494497, and 01495018 to address further observations provided by the inspectors related to the content and application of FP-OP-OL-0.",111,2379,2621,ML15313A275.txt,U

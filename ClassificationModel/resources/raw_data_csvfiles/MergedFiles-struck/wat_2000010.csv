"ATTACHMENT 2 NRC'S REVISED REACTOR OVERSIGHT PROCESS The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) revamped its inspection, assessment, and enforcement programs for commercial nuclear power plants.",165,0,200,wat_2000010.txt,U
The new process takes into account improvements in the performance of the nuclear industry over the past 25 years and improved approaches of inspecting safety performance at NRC licensed plants.,165,200,394,wat_2000010.txt,U
"The new process monitors licensee performance in three broad areas (called strategic performance areas): reactor safety (avoiding accidents and reducing the consequences of accidents if they occur), radiation safety (protecting plant employees and the public during routine operations), and safeguards (protecting the plant against sabotage or other security threats).",165,394,762,wat_2000010.txt,U
The process focuses on licensee performance within each of seven cornerstones of safety in the three areas: Reactor Safety Â·Initiating Events Â·Mitigating Systems Â·Barrier Integrity Â·Emergency Preparedness Radiation Safety Â·Occupational Â·Public Safeguards Â·Physical Protection,165,762,1037,wat_2000010.txt,U
"To monitor these seven cornerstones of safety, the NRC used two processes that generate information about the safety significance of plant operations: inspections and performance indicators.",167,0,190,wat_2000010.txt,U
"Inspection findings will be evaluated according to their potential significance for safety, using the significance determination process, and assigned colors of GREEN, WHITE, YELLOW or RED.",167,190,379,wat_2000010.txt,U
"GREEN findings are indicative of issues that, while they may not be desirable, represent very low safety significance.",167,379,497,wat_2000010.txt,U
WHITE findings indicate issues that are of low to moderate safety significance.,167,497,576,wat_2000010.txt,U
YELLOW findings are issues that are of substantial safety significance.,167,576,647,wat_2000010.txt,U
RED findings represent issues that are of high safety significance with a significant reduction in safety margin.,167,647,760,wat_2000010.txt,U
Performance indicator data will be compared to established criteria for measuring licensee performance in terms of potential safety.,167,760,892,wat_2000010.txt,U
"Based on prescribed thresholds, the indicators will be classified by color representing varying levels of performance and incremental degradation in safety: GREEN, WHITE, YELLOW, or RED.",167,892,1078,wat_2000010.txt,U
GREEN indicators represent performance at a level requiring no additional NRC oversight beyond the baseline inspections.,167,1078,1198,wat_2000010.txt,U
WHITE corresponds to performance that may result in increased NRC oversight.,167,1198,1274,wat_2000010.txt,U
YELLOW represents performance that minimally reduces safety margin and requires even more NRC oversight.,167,1274,1378,wat_2000010.txt,U
RED indicates performance that represents a significant reduction in safety margin but still provides adequate protection to public health and safety.,167,1378,1528,wat_2000010.txt,U
The assessment process integrates performance indicators and inspection so the agency can reach objective conclusions regarding overall plant performance.,167,1528,1682,wat_2000010.txt,U
"The agency will use an Action Matrix to determine in a systematic, predictable manner which regulatory actions should be taken based on a licensee's performance.",167,1682,1843,wat_2000010.txt,U
The NRC's actions in response to the significance (as represented by the color) of issues will be the same for performance indicators as for inspection findings.,167,1843,2004,wat_2000010.txt,U
"As a licensee's safety performance degrades, the NRC will take more and increasingly significant action, which can include shutting down a plant, as described in the Action Matrix.",167,2004,2184,wat_2000010.txt,U

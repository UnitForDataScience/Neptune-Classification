The RP technician provided NRC with a wide-range energy-compensated Geiger-Mueller (GM) instrument to measure gamma radiation.,45,548,674,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
Neutron monitoring equipment was not provided at the time of the ISFSI pad walkdown.,45,674,758,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
The inspectors found the 11 loaded HI-STORM 100 casks to be in excellent physical condition.,45,758,850,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
No flammable or combustible materials were observed inside the ISFSI protected area.,45,850,934,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
An NRC inspector took general area radiological measurements to confirm the levels reported on the most recent site survey.,45,934,1057,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U

Environmental monitoring data from 2011 thru 2013 for the ISFSI pad was provided for review.,45,2168,2260,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
The data for 2011 and 2012 was from four monitoring locations that contained an optically stimulated luminescent (OSL) dosimeter which were deployed as part of CPNPP General Area Monitoring (GAM) Program for measuring site-wide ambient radiation levels.,45,2260,2513,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
The four OSLs were responsible for measuring the direct radiological impacts of the loaded casks to locations in close proximity to the ISFSI pad.,45,2513,2659,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
During 2013 the OSLs were replaced by thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) that performed the same dose measurement function.,45,2659,2783,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U

The TN Bulletin noted numerous issues that may have contributed to the hydrogen deflagration at Nine Mile Point.,58,1817,1929,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
"These issues included: the use of helium as the purging gas, the RKI Eagle 1 monitor used at NMP had not been calibrated for its intended use or properly setup, and the sample line from cask to the instrument was 10 to 12 feet long with several low spots where water was found to be in the line.",58,1929,2224,ML13298A103.txt,"D, P",U,D

Holtec loading operations require an argon purge to be initiated during any welding operations to remove any combustible gas out of the cask and away from weld area.,58,3008,3173,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
"Once the root pass had been welded the ""stationary"" monitor sampled gas from the MPC which was an oxygen free environment containing only argon and possibly hydrogen.",58,3173,3339,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U

"At NMP, helium is close to the same weight as hydrogen and much lighter than oxygen and would be inadequate for displacing those elements by weight alone.",62,309,463,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
Further the RKI Eagle 1 instrument used at NMP was found to be inadequately calibrated for use in a helium only environment and the monitor contained an internal inlet moisture filter drain that was found to be in the open position but was required to be in the closed position.,62,463,741,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U

"The Type 201-11 ""stationary"" monitor was equipped with an internal diffuser fitting and was not reliant upon the sample gas as the source for oxygen to detect a combustible gas.",62,1102,1279,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
"The Type 101 ""handheld"" monitor did not contain the diffuser fitting and as such required the sample gas to contain at least 7% oxygen by volume for the catalytic combustion sensor to function properly.",62,1279,1481,ML13298A103.txt,D,U,D

"In the first campaign the ""stationary"" monitor was kept close to the MPC canister with a sample tubing length of approximately five feet.",62,1738,1875,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
In the second campaign the hydrogen monitor was positioned in the welders low dose area near the welding remote controlling equipment.,62,1875,2009,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
The sample tubing was measured to be approximately 85 feet long wrapping along multiple walls and up twenty feet in elevation.,62,2009,2135,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
Through the review of the TN bulletin a walk-down of the sample line tubing was performed by the Holtec welders.,62,2135,2247,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
Several dips in the sample line were discovered which contained small amounts of water condensate.,62,2247,2345,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U
No loop seal of water had formed in the tubing.,62,2345,2392,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U

"After the completion of Cask #12 and prior to the operations associated with Cask #13, Comanche Peak set-up a procedural test of the current hydrogen monitoring equipment by procuring a test bottle of 95 percent nitrogen and 5 percent hydrogen to ensure the equipment and setup used could sufficiently sample a combustible gas mixture as required.",62,2552,2899,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U

The Eagle 1 Type 201-11 did alarm almost instantaneously.,62,3133,3190,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U

This could include in situ testing under simulated conditions to prove that the gas monitors are functioning or will function as required and/or calibration verification from the monitor vendor that would demonstrate the equipment would function as required.,66,498,756,ML13298A103.txt,U,U,U

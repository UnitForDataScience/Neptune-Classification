258,The new process takes into account improvements in the performance of the nuclear industry over the past 25 years and improved approaches of inspecting safety performance at NRC licensed plants.,165.0,200.0,394.0,wat_2000010.txt,0.0,U,U,U
259,"The new process monitors licensee performance in three broad areas (called strategic performance areas): reactor safety (avoiding accidents and reducing the consequences of accidents if they occur), radiation safety (protecting plant employees and the public during routine operations), and safeguards (protecting the plant against sabotage or other security threats).",165.0,394.0,762.0,wat_2000010.txt,0.0,U,U,U

262,"Inspection findings will be evaluated according to their potential significance for safety, using the significance determination process, and assigned colors of GREEN, WHITE, YELLOW or RED.",167.0,190.0,379.0,wat_2000010.txt,0.0,U,U,U

265,YELLOW findings are issues that are of substantial safety significance.,167.0,576.0,647.0,wat_2000010.txt,0.0,U,U,U
266,RED findings represent issues that are of high safety significance with a significant reduction in safety margin.,167.0,647.0,760.0,wat_2000010.txt,0.0,U,U,U
267,Performance indicator data will be compared to established criteria for measuring licensee performance in terms of potential safety.,167.0,760.0,892.0,wat_2000010.txt,0.0,U,U,U

270,WHITE corresponds to performance that may result in increased NRC oversight.,167.0,1198.0,1274.0,wat_2000010.txt,1.0,U,U,U
271,YELLOW represents performance that minimally reduces safety margin and requires even more NRC oversight.,167.0,1274.0,1378.0,wat_2000010.txt,0.0,U,U,U
272,RED indicates performance that represents a significant reduction in safety margin but still provides adequate protection to public health and safety.,167.0,1378.0,1528.0,wat_2000010.txt,1.0,U,U,U

275,The NRC's actions in response to the significance (as represented by the color) of issues will be the same for performance indicators as for inspection findings.,167.0,1843.0,2004.0,wat_2000010.txt,0.0,U,U,U

335,"The inspectors subsequently questioned whether certain steps in procedure 18038-1, in the event of a large fire in FA 1-CB-L1-A that would require evacuation of the Unit 1 and Unit 2 MCRs, would be able to be performed from the RSPs within the time constraints specified in the CRFASE in order to prevent or mitigate the adverse effects of certain spurious actuations.",174.0,1242.0,1610.0,ML12027A131.txt,0.0,U,U,U

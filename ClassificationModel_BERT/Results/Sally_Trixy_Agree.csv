"A self-revealing NCV for failure to comply with 10 CFR, Appendix B, Criterion V, ""Instruction, Procedures, and Drawings,"" was identified when operators discovered a significant leak in the copper oil filter tubing on the 22 CAC on May 1, 2007, that made the 22 CAC inoperable.",59,1179,1455,ML072260460.txt,O,O
The finding has a cross-cutting aspect in the area of problem identification and resolution because PSEG did not take appropriate corrective actions to address safety issues and adverse trends in a timely manner commensurate with their safety significance (P.1.d).,59,2140,2404,ML072260460.txt,T,O

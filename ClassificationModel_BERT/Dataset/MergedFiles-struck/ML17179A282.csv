Cooper Nuclear Station Residual Heat Removal Minimum Flow Lines Isolation Detailed Risk Evaluation The detailed risk evaluation estimated that the issue was of very low safety significance (Green).,204,0,198,ML17179A282.txt,U
"In this evaluation, the analyst assumed the exposure time to be 89 days, 12 hours, and 49 minutes, which encompasses the time from which the licensee exited shutdown cooling on the residual heat removal system while starting the plant up from their refueling outage to the time the valves were returned to their normal position.",204,198,526,ML17179A282.txt,U
Exposure time during the outage was not considered because the motor operated valve in the minimum flow line is intentionally shut at that time for the shutdown cooling line-up.,204,526,703,ML17179A282.txt,U
"The analyst also assumed that operators would align an alternate flow path with a failure probability of 2.0E-3, which was derived using a SPAR-H analysis.",204,703,858,ML17179A282.txt,U
The SPAR-H analysis was determined to have no diagnosis applicable and be an action-only analysis since operators would be unaware of the isolated minimum flow line.,204,858,1023,ML17179A282.txt,U
"Also, in the SPAR-H analysis, stress was judged to be the only performance driver and was assigned as ""high"" because in the postulated scenarios, many alarms and actions would be occurring.",204,1023,1212,ML17179A282.txt,U
"The basic event for this action was added to the model with ""AND"" logic to the failure events to account for the operators' ability to align a flow path for the residual heat removal pumps with their flow line isolated before the pumps would be damaged and subsequently unavailable.",204,1212,1494,ML17179A282.txt,U
This basic event was applied similarly to all minimum flow lines since the action is embedded in the plant procedures and was placed under fault trees for both trains of residual heat removal and suppression pool cooling.,204,1494,1715,ML17179A282.txt,U
A different SPAR-H basic event with a failure probability of 2.0E-1 was applied to the low pressure coolant injection mode fault trees because less time was available.,204,1715,1882,ML17179A282.txt,U
The manual valves that were closed were considered to be part of a common cause group which also included the same valves in the other residual heat removal trains.,204,1882,2046,ML17179A282.txt,U
"To create the common cause failure event, the analyst consulted with Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for common cause parameters.",204,2046,2175,ML17179A282.txt,U
Basic events for each train's minimum flow line check valve failing closed were used as the individual common cause component events.,204,2175,2308,ML17179A282.txt,U
The common mode failure event was then placed under the fault trees for both trains of residual heat removal and suppression pool cooling.,204,2308,2446,ML17179A282.txt,U
"The analyst used Cooper SPAR model Revision 8.50, run on SAPHIRE Version 8.1.5, with the previously described modifications to the model.",204,2446,2583,ML17179A282.txt,U
Truncation was set at 1E-12.,204,2583,2611,ML17179A282.txt,U
"Applying the assumptions and model modifications, the increase in core damage frequency was estimated to be 3.2E-7/year due to internal events.",204,2611,2754,ML17179A282.txt,U
"Dominant sequences were losses of electrical buses 1F and 1G, which were mitigated by the reactor core isolation cooling and high pressure coolant injection systems.",204,2754,2919,ML17179A282.txt,U
"The analyst estimated the increase in core damage frequency due to external events to be 1.6E-7/year, derived of fire, tornado, and seismic events.",204,2919,3066,ML17179A282.txt,U
The analyst ran numerous fire cases informed by the results of the internal events from the Cooper SPAR model and the licensee's fire probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) information.,204,3066,3248,ML17179A282.txt,U
"For each of these postulated fire scenarios, the increase in core damage frequency was estimated by calculating the effects of the fire with and without the performance deficiency present.",204,3248,3436,ML17179A282.txt,U
Fire ignition frequencies from the licensee's NFPA 805 risk informed fire protection model were used in combination with conditional core damage probabilities derived using the Cooper SPAR model informed from the licensee's damaged equipment for the different fire scenarios.,204,3436,3711,ML17179A282.txt,U
The results were applied over,204,3711,3740,ML17179A282.txt,U

the 91-day exposure time.,208,0,26,ML17179A282.txt,U
The analyst combined all fire scenarios to estimate the increase in core damage frequency from fires to be 1.5E-7/year.,208,26,145,ML17179A282.txt,U
"For tornados, the analyst estimated the frequency of a category EF2 or greater tornado occurring onsite to be 2.20E-4/year using the data developed by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Research utilizing the methodology from, ""Review of Methods for Estimation of High Wind and Tornado Hazard Frequencies,"" dated December 2012.",208,145,467,ML17179A282.txt,U
The analyst assumed that these high wind events would cause an unrecoverable loss of site power.,208,467,563,ML17179A282.txt,U
This yielded a conditional core damage probability of 4.1E-6 that when applied to the tornado/high wind initiating event frequency yielded an estimate in the increase of core damage frequency of 9.0E-10/year.,208,563,771,ML17179A282.txt,U
"For earthquakes, the analyst obtained the frequency of a seismically induced loss of offsite power of 1.33E-4/year using Volume 2, ""External Events,"" of the RASP Handbook.",208,771,942,ML17179A282.txt,U
The analyst conservatively assumed that an earthquake would cause an unrecoverable loss of site power.,208,942,1044,ML17179A282.txt,U
This yielded a conditional core damage probability of 4.1E-6 that when applied to the seismically induced loss of offsite power frequency yielded an estimate in the increase of core damage frequency of 5.4E-10/year.,208,1044,1259,ML17179A282.txt,U
"Combining internal and external events, the analyst estimated the total increase in core damage frequency to be 4.7E-7/year, or of very low safety significance (Green).",208,1259,1427,ML17179A282.txt,U

"In response to the inadvertent isolation of Division I residual heat removal (RHR) minimum flow piping, a Special Inspection will be performed.",225,0,143,ML17179A282.txt,U
This event led to the potential loss of a safety function for the RHR system and revealed weaknesses in the operator fundamentals area associated with configuration control.,225,143,316,ML17179A282.txt,U
You are hereby designated as the Special Inspection team leader.,225,316,380,ML17179A282.txt,U
"The following member is assigned to your team: Â· A. Nick Hernandez, Resident Inspector, South Texas Project Basis On October 7, 2016, when lifting a clearance order during an outage, operators failed to reposition the residual heat removal (RHR) Division I minimum flow isolation valves (RHR-V-58 and RHR-V-60) for RHR pumps A and C to the open position prior to reinstalling the valve sealing devices.",225,380,782,ML17179A282.txt,T
"As a result, these minimum flow paths remained isolated until this condition was discovered on February 5, 2017.",225,782,894,ML17179A282.txt,U
"From November 23 to November 29, 2016, operators conducted a sealed valve audit, which failed to identify that these valves were in the incorrect position.",225,894,1049,ML17179A282.txt,H
"During a subsequent sealed valve audit conducted on February 5, 2017, operators identified that these valves were in the incorrect position.",225,1049,1189,ML17179A282.txt,U
The affected RHR pumps were operated approximately ten times during the four-month time period with the minimum flow paths isolated.,225,1189,1321,ML17179A282.txt,U
"Management Directive 8.3, ""NRC Incident Investigation Program,"" was used to evaluate the level of NRC response for this event.",225,1321,1447,ML17179A282.txt,U
"In evaluating the criteria of MD 8.3, it was determined that the event met two of the deterministic criteria.",225,1447,1556,ML17179A282.txt,U
This event potentially led to the loss of a safety function used to mitigate an actual event.,225,1556,1649,ML17179A282.txt,U
"Specifically, it was determined that the Division II RHR was out of service for a total of approximately 71.5 hours during the time period that Division I RHR minimum flow paths were isolated.",225,1649,1841,ML17179A282.txt,U
The condition of having the minimum flow isolation valves closed may have rendered one or more of the RHR system safety functions inoperable for Division I RHR when Division II RHR was unavailable.,225,1841,2038,ML17179A282.txt,U
"Additionally, this event involved questions or concerns pertaining to licensee operational performance.",225,2038,2141,ML17179A282.txt,O

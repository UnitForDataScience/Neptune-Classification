U,The licensee removed the transient combustibles and planned on reviewing training related to the transient combustibles.,23,1635,1755,ML11300A116.txt
U,The inspectors determined that this finding was more than minor because the transient combustible materials were stored near safety-related cables and components and formed credible fire scenarios.,23,1755,1952,ML11300A116.txt
U,This finding was of very low safety significance because the materials would not result in ignition of a fire from existing sources of heat or electrical energy.,23,1952,2113,ML11300A116.txt
O,This finding had a cross-cutting aspect in the area of Human Performance within the decision making component because the licensee did not properly communicate and reinforce expectations related to the fire protection program implementation concerning transient combustibles to personnel performing maintenance work and fire watches.,23,2113,2446,ML11300A116.txt

U,Allowing a degradation to the second defense-in-depth element without a compensatory measure affected the ability to achieve and maintain safe shutdown in the event of a fire in that fixed or automatic suppression capability was reduced and an unsuppressed fire would challenge the ability to safely shutdown the plant.,107,907,1226,ML11300A116.txt

U,"The finding was determined to be more than minor because failure to obtain NRC approval prior to making a change adverse to safe shutdown was associated with the Initiating Events cornerstone attribute of protection against external factors (i.e., fire) and affected the cornerstone objective of limiting the likelihood of those events that upset plant stability and challenge critical safety functions during shutdown as well as power operations.",107,2862,3309,ML11300A116.txt

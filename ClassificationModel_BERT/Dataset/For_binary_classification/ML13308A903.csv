O,"Specifically, the licensee did not update Dresden UFSAR Section 5.4.8, ""Reactor Water Cleanup System (RWCU),"" to reflect changes made during a design modification installed on Unit 3 in 1997.",91,401,592,ML13308A903.txt
U,The design changes included reducing the pipe dimension of RWCU piping outside of the primary containment and eliminating a string of regenerative and non-regenerative heat exchangers.,91,592,776,ML13308A903.txt
U,Discussion: The licensee performed design modifications to remove components potentially susceptible to intragranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) to the Unit 2 (1996) and Unit 3 (1997) RWCU systems to include reducing the dimensions of piping outside of containment from 8 inches to 6 inches in diameter and by isolating one string of regenerative and non-regenerative heat exchangers on each unit.,91,776,1180,ML13308A903.txt
O,"During a recent HELB analysis to support the increased core flow (ICF) license amendment, the licensee noted that previous HELB analyses, such as for extended power uprate, did not consider the effects of feed water temperature reduction (FWTR) on the mass and energy liberated during a HELB on environmentally qualified (EQ) safety related components in the reactor building and the 10 CFR 100 accident 10 Enclosure",91,1180,1596,ML13308A903.txt

U,From a HELB standpoint this would mean greater mass and energy would be released potentially impacting the EQ rating of safety related components in the vicinity of the break and offsite dose limits under 10 CFR 100.,93,345,561,ML13308A903.txt
U,As a result the licensee re-evaluated HELB for RWCU and the instrument line break.,93,561,643,ML13308A903.txt
U,The inspectors noted that the licensee reported that non-conservatisms rising from not considering FWTR would be mitigated and actually overcome by the significant conservatisms built into the RWCU HELB calculations.,93,643,859,ML13308A903.txt
U,The most significant conservatism was that the RWCU HELB calculations did not consider the change in piping dimensions which were implemented as a part of the major modifications that took place in the 1990's.,93,859,1068,ML13308A903.txt
U,"The inspectors determined it was necessary to review other design documents such as the UFSAR, piping and instrumentation diagrams, and procedures to ensure that the modifications previously performed were adequately depicted and accounted for.",93,1068,1312,ML13308A903.txt
U,"The inspectors noted that the system description, as documented in UFSAR Section 5.4.8, ""Reactor Water Cleanup System,"" incorrectly reported the design and operation of the Unit 3 RWCU system as that of which pre-existed the 1997 major modification.",93,1312,1561,ML13308A903.txt
U,"Specifically, the flow rate of the system, number of heat exchangers available, and the standard RWCU pump and valve lineup were incorrectly reported in the document.",93,1561,1727,ML13308A903.txt
U,"Following identification of the discrepancy by inspectors, the licensee entered the issue into the station CAP as Issue Reports (IRs) 1541190 and created a UFSAR Change Request and initiated an extent of condition review for this deficiency.",93,1727,1968,ML13308A903.txt
U,"The licensee's review identified that UFSAR Change Request 97-103 had been generated at the time of the modification, but was not processed to completion.",93,1968,2122,ML13308A903.txt
U,In addition the licensee continued its analysis of FWTR on RWCU and instrument line break HELB.,93,2122,2217,ML13308A903.txt
U,Results indicated that additional energy released during these events would not challenge the EQ rating of safety related components in the reactor building or 10 CFR 100 release limits.,93,2217,2403,ML13308A903.txt
U,Analysis: The inspectors determined that the failure to update the UFSAR was contrary to 10 CFR 50.71(e) and was a performance deficiency warranting a significance evaluation.,93,2403,2578,ML13308A903.txt
O,"This violation was determined to be more than minor in accordance with IMC 0612, ""Power Reactor Inspection Reports,"" Appendix B, ""Issue Screening,"" because, if left uncorrected, the performance deficiency could have led to a more significant safety concern.",93,2578,2835,ML13308A903.txt
O,"Specifically, failure to update the UFSAR with the actual RWCU system configuration prevented the inspectors from readily concluding that the design change would not require additional calculational analyses for HELB.",93,2835,3052,ML13308A903.txt
U,Violations of 10 CFR 50.71(e) are dispositioned using the traditional enforcement process because they are considered to be violations that potentially impede or impact the regulatory process.,93,3052,3244,ML13308A903.txt

U,Operators on scene rapidly shut the secondary containment boundary door on the 2/3 EDG side of the interlock ensuring that reactor building to outside environment differential pressure requirements were maintained at all times.,193,509,736,ML13308A903.txt
U,"At the time of the event, operators were passing through the 2/3 EDG side interlock door while a radiation protection member was accessing the interlock from the reactor building side.",193,736,920,ML13308A903.txt
U,Information ascertained from the individuals involved during the licensee's Prompt Investigation identified a potential fault in the interlock circuitry associated with the 2/3 EDG room side door as the radiation protection individual observed no interlock warning light indications and was able to open the reactor building side door with the 2/3 EDG side door already in an open status.,193,920,1308,ML13308A903.txt

U,The licensee determined that the latch bolt monitor (LBM) switch tripper associated with the 2/3 EDG room door strike had repositioned vertically in the downward direction due to use resulting in a micro switch mechanically linked to the LBM receiving an inaccurate indication of door position.,193,1515,1809,ML13308A903.txt
U,"Specifically, as the 2/3 EDG closes, the LBM is mechanically repositioned by the door latch which in turn mechanically closes a contact in a micro switch which sends a logic signal to the interlock control logic allowing the reactor building interlock door to be opened.",193,1809,2079,ML13308A903.txt
U,"In this instance, the LBM having vertically shifted over time was able to make up the micro switch contact with the door in the open position even though the LBM was free of the door latch.",193,2079,2268,ML13308A903.txt
U,This provided a permissive signal to the reactor building door.,193,2268,2331,ML13308A903.txt
U,Licensee corrective actions included replacing the entire 2/3 EDG room door strike mechanism with one that includes a redundant micro switch which would account for potential vertical shifting of the LBM over the life of the component.,193,2331,2566,ML13308A903.txt
U,"In addition, the licensee is working with the vendor to design a complementary magnetic limit switch to complement the door strike logic circuit and change the logic circuit to include an exclusive or (XOR) gate logic design.",193,2566,2791,ML13308A903.txt

T,At this point operations management failed to fully question abnormal control board light indications on both units and failed surveillances on both units associated with not being able to achieve downscale conditions for the input LPRM detection circuitry.,197,339,596,ML13308A903.txt
U,"On July 23, 2013, Unit 2 operators selected control rod F6 (a non-peripheral control rod) and stepped it outward from position 00 to 02 and on July 27, 2013, Unit 2 non-peripheral control rods D8 and M8 were selected and repositioned outward from position 00 to 08.",197,596,861,ML13308A903.txt

U,Operations personnel realizing that control rods had been operated on Unit 2 during this time finally requested a design review from engineering to determine if these abnormal indications and failed cards could have indicated an actual failed RBM channel.,197,1606,1861,ML13308A903.txt
T,Design engineering's review determined that failed relays in the quad trip cards of Unit 2 RBM channel 8 and Unit 3 RBM channel 7 manifested in LPRM Bypassed lights inappropriately extinguished and the failure to create surveillance requirement conditions during subsequent testing on both units and represented failure of both RBM channels.,197,1861,2202,ML13308A903.txt

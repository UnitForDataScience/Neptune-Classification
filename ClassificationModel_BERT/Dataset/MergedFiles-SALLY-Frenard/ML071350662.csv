"Specifically, Waterford Final Safety Analysis Report, Section 2.4.2.3.3.d, describes openings in the dry cooling tower cubicles that help preclude the possibility of flooding Motor Control Centers 3A315-S and 3B315-S during the probable maximum precipitation event.",31,1140,1405,ML071350662.txt,U,U
These openings serve as a backup to the floor drains located in each cubicle.,31,1405,1482,ML071350662.txt,U,U
"Current plant configuration and Drawing G-499 S06, ""Common Foundation Structure, Masonry,"" Sheet 6, do not conform to the design basis, in that there are no openings other than the floor drains.",31,1482,1676,ML071350662.txt,D,D

The inspectors identified a finding of very low safety significance for failure to assure that the design basis for the dry cooling tower diesel-driven sump pumps was properly implemented.,39,6,194,ML071350662.txt,D,D
"Specifically, the Train B dry cooling tower diesel-driven sump pump was stored near nonseismic equipment which could fall and damage the pump during an operating-basis earthquake.",39,194,373,ML071350662.txt,U,U
The dry cooling tower diesel-driven sump pumps are equipment important to safety that are required to protect the ultimate heat sink during a standard project storm coincident with an operating-basis earthquake.,39,373,584,ML071350662.txt,U,U
The licensee entered this deficiency into their corrective action program for resolution.,39,584,673,ML071350662.txt,U,U
"The finding was greater than minor because it affected the mitigating systems cornerstone objective (design control attribute) to assure the availability, reliability, and capability of systems that respond to initiating events to prevent undesirable consequences.",39,673,937,ML071350662.txt,U,U
"Using the Phase 1 worksheet in Manual Chapter 0609, ""Significance Determination Process,"" the inspectors determined that this finding was of very low safety significance because the finding was a design deficiency that was confirmed not to result in a loss of operability per ""Part 9900, Technical Guidance, Operability Determination Process for Operability and Functional Assessment.""",39,937,1322,ML071350662.txt,U,U

The licensee presented a position paper related to the dry cooling tower areas cubicle openings.,93,325,421,ML071350662.txt,U,U
The inspector reviewed the licensee's position paper and determined that the minor example cited in the paper did not apply to this performance deficiency.,93,421,576,ML071350662.txt,U,U
"Specifically, the inspector determined that the performance deficiency did not constitute a minor dimensional discrepancy because there was a loss of the design function of the openings to further preclude the possibility of flooding Motor Control Centers 3A315-S and 3B315-S.",93,576,852,ML071350662.txt,U,U

The normal floor drains had historically clogged and the drainage openings were needed to limit flood related challenges to the motor control centers.,93,1370,1520,ML071350662.txt,U,U
"The finding was determined to be of very low safety significance because the deficiency did not represent an actual loss of the wet and dry cooling tower systems safety functions per ""Part 9900: Technical Guidance, Operability Determinations & Functional Assessments for Resolution of Degraded or Nonconforming Conditions Adverse to Quality.""",93,1520,1862,ML071350662.txt,U,U

The inspectors identified a finding of very low safety significance for the failure to ensure that the design basis for the dry cooling tower diesel-driven sump pumps was properly implemented.,161,188,380,ML071350662.txt,D,D
This failure resulted in storing the Train B dry cooling tower diesel-driven sump pump near nonseismic equipment which could fall and damage the pump during an operating-basis earthquake.,161,380,567,ML071350662.txt,D,D
The dry cooling tower diesel-driven sump pumps are equipment important to safety that are required to protect the ultimate heat sink during a standard project storm coincident with an operating-basis earthquake.,161,567,778,ML071350662.txt,U,U
Description.,161,778,790,ML071350662.txt,U,U
The inspectors identified that the licensee had inappropriately located the Train B diesel-driven ultimate heat sink sump pumps near non-seismically qualified piping.,161,790,956,ML071350662.txt,O,O
The inspectors were concerned that the piping could fall and damage the pump during an operating-basis earthquake.,161,956,1070,ML071350662.txt,U,U
The failure to locate the pump in a location free from potentially seismic induced damage was inconsistent with the Final Safety Analysis Report.,161,1070,1215,ML071350662.txt,"O,P",O
"Section 2.4.2.3.4, ""Effects of Standard Project Storm on Cooling Tower Areas,"" credits the diesel driven pump for protecting vital equipment during a standard project storm coincident with an operating-basis earthquake.",161,1215,1434,ML071350662.txt,U,U
"Contrary to this commitment, the diesel driven pumps were located directly under non-seismic category I piping.",161,1434,1545,ML071350662.txt,U,U
"In response to the inspectors' concerns, the licensee performed a seismic analysis and determined that the non-seismic piping would not fall during an operating basis earthquake.",161,1545,1723,ML071350662.txt,O,O
Analysis.,161,1723,1732,ML071350662.txt,U,U
"The finding was greater than minor because it affected the mitigating systems cornerstone objective (design control attribute) to assure the availability, reliability, and capability of systems that respond to initiating events to prevent undesirable consequences.",161,1732,1996,ML071350662.txt,O,U
"Using the Phase 1 worksheet in Manual Chapter 0609, ""Significance Determination Process,"" the inspectors determined that this finding was of very low safety significance because the finding was a design deficiency that was confirmed not to result in a loss of operability per ""Part 9900, Technical Guidance, Operability Determination Process for Operability and Functional Assessment.""",161,1996,2381,ML071350662.txt,U,U
The inspectors determined the cause of this finding was not related to a crosscutting element because the performance deficiency does not reflect current operating performance.,161,2381,2557,ML071350662.txt,U,U
Enforcement.,161,2557,2569,ML071350662.txt,U,U
This finding was associated with non-safety related equipment and no violation of NRC requirements occurred.,161,2569,2677,ML071350662.txt,U,U
"The finding has been entered into the licensee's corrective action program as Condition Report CR-WF3-2007-0824 (FIN 05000382/2007002-02, Dry Cooling Tower Sump Pump Design Bases Change).",161,2677,2864,ML071350662.txt,U,U

4OA7 Licensee Identified Violations The following violation of very low safety significance (Green) was identified by the licensee and is a violation of NRC requirements.,167,793,963,ML071350662.txt,U,U

"Consequently, the train was rendered inoperable until January 10, 2007, when it failed to run during a surveillance.",167,1318,1434,ML071350662.txt,U,U
The failure to follow procedures was a violation of Technical Specification 6.8.1.a.,167,1434,1518,ML071350662.txt,"T,P",T
It was licensee identified because it was found during licensee initiated surveillance activities.,167,1518,1616,ML071350662.txt,U,U
